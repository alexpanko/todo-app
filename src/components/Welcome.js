      <p>Hi mate!</p>
      <p>
        Start adding your tasks for a great day. Be sharp and don't plan too
        much. Three is a magic number:)
      </p>
      <p>It's my messing around app, so don't expect too much.</p>
      <p>
        Keep in mind I don't store your tasks anywhere, so if you refresh the
        browser, everything will be gone.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, you need to log in with Google to use the app. I did it to
        learn Firebase auth functionality :)
      </p>
      <p>Anyway! Let's set up for success!!!</p>
      <p>Cheers, Alex</p>
