# To do app for a great day

This is a simple task tracker app created during the Troopl hackathon challenge.

## Project overview

I've created this app using following technologies and tools:
* ReactJS
* React Bootstrap front-end framework to style components
* Google Firebase for user authontification 

## What is working
* User can login with Google account
* User can logout
* User can create tasks 
* User can mark task as done
* User can delete task

### `Note`

Tasks are stored in the state.

### `Next steps`

I don't plan to work on this project as it was a hackathon challenge. However here is a few ideas on what can be done:
* Use database to store tasks (e.g. Google Firebase)
* Add a "carrot" - what you get if you done with all tasks
* Limit tasks to max 3 (magic number :))
* Add tracking to see day to day pace
